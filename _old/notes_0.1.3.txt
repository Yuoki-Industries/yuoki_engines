YI-Engines 0.1.3 - 2015-Jul-16

- new graphics for some icons
- internal gearbox (fluid)-storeage changed
- 1 gearbox bump 100 Pressure/Torque (ingame temperature) so you need to combine for maximal power-output (max is 500 T)
- every gearbox has a friction-loss with lubricant-oil it's lower compare to water-cooling
- you can build a cycle but friction-loss makes this idea useless, but you can after a generator bump Pressure/Torque again.
- works with factorio 0.12
